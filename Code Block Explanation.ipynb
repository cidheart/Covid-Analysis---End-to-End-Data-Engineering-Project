    "Sure, let's break down the code step-by-step to understand how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def download_and_load_query_results(client: boto3.client, query_response: Dict) -> pd.DataFrame:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This defines a function named `download_and_load_query_results` that takes two parameters:\n",
    "     - `client`: A boto3 client object for interacting with AWS services.\n",
    "     - `query_response`: A dictionary containing information about a previously executed Athena query.\n",
    "   - The function is expected to return a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **While Loop:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   while True:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This initiates an infinite loop that will continue until it is explicitly broken.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Try Block:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       client.get_query_results(\n",
    "           QueryExecutionId=query_response[\"QueryExecutionId\"]\n",
    "       )\n",
    "       break\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Inside the try block, the `client.get_query_results` method is called with the `QueryExecutionId` from the `query_response` dictionary.\n",
    "   - This method is used to retrieve the results of a query that was executed using AWS Athena.\n",
    "   - If the call is successful, the loop is broken with `break`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Exception Handling:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   except Exception as err:\n",
    "       if \"not yet finished\" in str(err):\n",
    "           time.sleep(0.001)\n",
    "       else:\n",
    "           raise err\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - If an exception occurs during the `get_query_results` call, it is caught by the `except` block.\n",
    "   - If the exception message contains the string \"not yet finished\", it implies that the query execution is still in progress. The code then waits for 0.001 seconds using `time.sleep(0.001)` before trying again.\n",
    "   - If the exception is due to any other reason, the error is re-raised using `raise err`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Temporary File Location:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   temp_file_location: str = \"athena_query_results.csv\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - A string variable `temp_file_location` is defined to store the path where the Athena query results will be temporarily saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **S3 Client Creation:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   s3_client = boto3.client(\n",
    "       \"s3\",\n",
    "       aws_access_key_id=AWS_ACCESS_KEY,\n",
    "       aws_secret_access_key=AWS_SECRET_KEY,\n",
    "       region_name = AWS_REGION,\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - A boto3 client for interacting with Amazon S3 is created using the provided AWS access key, secret key, and region.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Download File from S3:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   s3_client.download_file(\n",
    "       S3_BUCKET_NAME,\n",
    "       f\"{S3_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY}/{query_response['QueryExecutionId']}.csv\",\n",
    "       temp_file_location,\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The `download_file` method of the S3 client is used to download the query results file from S3.\n",
    "   - The file is located in the S3 bucket specified by `S3_BUCKET_NAME` and the directory specified by `S3_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`. The file name is the `QueryExecutionId` with a `.csv` extension.\n",
    "   - The file is saved locally at the path specified by `temp_file_location`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Read CSV File:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   return pd.read_csv(temp_file_location)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The downloaded CSV file is read into a pandas DataFrame using `pd.read_csv`.\n",
    "   - The DataFrame is returned as the output of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `download_and_load_query_results` performs the following tasks:\n",
    "1. Waits for an Athena query to complete.\n",
    "2. Downloads the query results from S3.\n",
    "3. Loads the results into a pandas DataFrame and returns it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function handles the typical workflow of executing a query in Athena, waiting for the results, and then retrieving and processing those results."
